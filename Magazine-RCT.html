                <h3 class="list-title" id="rct-timeline"> A RCT Timeline</h3>
                <p>Of the Video Game Series</p>
                <ul class="lists">
                    <li>
                        <h4 class="list-subtitle">RollerCoaster Tycoon (1999)</h4>
                        <p>It is the first game of the RollerCoaster Tycoon series; it has two expansion packs – Added Attractions and Loopy Landscapes.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <h4 class="list-subtitle">RollerCoaster Tycoon 2 (2002)</h4>
                        <p>It is the second installment in the RollerCoaster Tycoon series. Like in its predecessor, the player must build successful theme parks to fulfill a set of objectives in various scenarios. The game was further expanded with two expansion packs, Wacky Worlds and Time Twister, which brought more themes and theme-inspired derivatives of existing rides, as well as new scenarios. These two add-ons were not worked on by Chris Sawyer.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <h4 class="list-subtitle">RollerCoaster Tycoon 3 (2004)</h4>
                        <p>It is the third installment of the RollerCoaster Tycoon series, but the first one from the series to use  3-dimensional graphics, as opposed to the 2-dimensional isometric view of the first two games. Players can now view their park at any angle, which helps players build in crowded areas, also 'ride the rides' in a first-person perspective. The game has two expansion packs: Soaked! that allows the user to build water parks and Wild! that allows the user to build zoo exhibits. </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <h4 class="list-subtitle">RollerCoaster Tycoon 3D (2012)</h4>
                        <p>The first spin-off and the first console-exclusive game in the series, it was released solely for the Nintendo 3DS portable game system. It is unique for its "Coaster Story" mode, in which the player begins the game as a young teenager eager to become a roller-coaster designer. The player's father, who manages a theme park, asks Chappy to mentor the player. </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <h4 class="list-subtitle">RollerCoaster Tycoon World (2016)</h4>
                        <p>As previous installments players are able to build rides, shops and roller coasters, while monitoring elements such as budget, visitor happiness and technology research. What is different is that when building roller coasters, the game makes use of a spline system instead of the old style of laying individual pieces. The new 'Park Pulse' mechanic allows players to quickly find out how their park is doing and and the customers' thoughts.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <h4 class="list-subtitle">RollerCoaster Tycoon Joyride (2018)</h4>
                        <p>It is another spin-off and console-exclusive game, different from all the other games in the series by being a roller coaster rail shooter with virtual reality support for PlayStation 4's PlayStation VR. Using the PlayStation Move Motion Controllers, the player can build 3D roller coasters. After completing a roller coaster track and testing it out, players can shoot passing-by objects with the PlayStation Move Motion Controllers while riding on the roller coaster. </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <h4 class="list-subtitle">RollerCoaster Tycoon Puzzle (2020)</h4>
                        <p>A very different approach to the game series. A Match 3 Park Building Mobile Game. It is a freemium tile-matching puzzle game similar to Candy Crush Saga, in which the tiles to match move each turn on rollercoaster tracks within each level. Completing levels helps the player to restore a run-down theme park as part of the game's narrative. Available on Android and iOS.</p>
